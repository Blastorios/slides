== Saruman Tower 

We want to begin the migration of our services from the our VM to a Kubernetes cluster:

* keep the Docker services
* migrate Traefik to Kubernetes
* migrate the Let's Encrypt certificates
* access to the Docker services through Traefik in Kubernetes

== Infrastructure Setup

* A K3S cluster on a VM reachable from a public IP `{public-ip}`
* `kubectl` and `helm` installed on the client machines

--
* Explain what is K3S and why we are using it
* Explain Helm behavior (tiller server side), interest (do not manipulate amount of YAML files)
