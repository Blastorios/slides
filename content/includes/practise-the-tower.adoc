image::tower.jpg[height=600px, width=400px]

== Saruman Tower 

We want to begin the migration of our services from the our VM to a Kubernetes cluster:

* keep the Docker services
* migrate Traefik to Kubernetes
* migrate the Let's Encrypt certificates
* access to the Docker services through Traefik in Kubernetes

== Infrastructure Setup

* A Kubernetes cluster (k3s) on a 2nd VM
** Get the IP on the spreadsheet (column "Kube IP (10.0.n.p)")
** Connect to the VM with the webshell: `ssh {kube_vm_ip}`

* `kubectl` and `helm` installed on the client machines

* Create a directory named `~/02-k8s-traefik` as working directory

--
* Explain what is K3S and why we are using it
* Explain Helm behavior (tiller server side), interest (do not manipulate amount of YAML files)
