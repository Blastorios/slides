== Saruman Tower 

We want to begin the migration of our services from the AWS VM to a Kubernetes cluster in AWS:

* keep the Docker services
* migrate Traefik to Kubernetes
* migrate the Let's Encrypt certificates
* access to the Docker services through Traefik in Kubernetes

== Infrastructure Setup

* An AWS EKS server with a public IP `35.178.178.237` and SSH access
* Kubernetes and Helm to deploy the infrastructure
