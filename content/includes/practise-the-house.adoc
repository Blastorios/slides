== The House

We want to begin the migration of our services from the Google Cloud VM to a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud:

* keep the Docker services
* migrate Traefik to Kubernetes
* access to the Docker services through Traefik in Kubernetes

== Infrastructure Setup

* A Google Cloud GKE server with a public IP `35.178.178.237` and SSH access
* A domain name `demo.containous.cloud` pointing to `35.178.178.237`
+
[source,bash]
----
$ dig +short demo.containous.cloud
35.178.178.237
----

* Kubernetes and Helm to deploy the infrastructure
