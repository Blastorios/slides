== Logs

* Difference between access / system logs
* Can you show internal behavior of your application
* Historical View

== Metrics

* Ressource metrics (CPU / Memory / IO Performance...)
* Application metrics (Req/s, Open Connections...) 
* Short-time period view

== Tracing

* Deep-Dive into how the app works
* Calltrace

== Result

* Combining all 3
* Possibility to fully diagnose problems
* Combination of Logs / Metric might show missbehaving apps
* Tracing for finding root cause
