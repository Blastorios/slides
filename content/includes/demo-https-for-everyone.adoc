== Goals

* Use HTTPS instead of HTTP
* Do NOT care about certificates and renewal
* Redirect any incoming HTTP request to HTTPS:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
http://{lab-domain}/
  -> https://{lab-domain}/

It uses the "ACME" protocol to verify that you control a given domain name and to issue you a certificate.

== Problem 1/4

* **Problem:**  How to tell Traefik to listen on port `443` for HTTPS requests?

* **Solution:**
** Create a new link:https://docs.traefik.io/basics/#entrypoints[entrypoint] with the flag link:https://docs.traefik.io/configuration/entrypoints/#cli[`--entrypoints`],
** And the default entrypoint with `--defaultentrypoints`:

----

== Problem 2/4

* **Problem**: How to tell Traefik to redirect request from http to https?

* **Solution:** Configure the new link:https://docs.traefik.io/basics/#entrypoints[entrypoint] `http` with the flag link:https://docs.traefik.io/configuration/entrypoints/#cli[`--entrypoints`]:
+
[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
include::../../demo/traefik-v1/software-forge/docker-compose-ssl.yml[tag=traefik-entrypoints-http]
----

== Problem 3/4

* **Problem**: How to tell Traefik to use Let's Encrypt for HTTPS?
+
* **Solution:** Configure the link:https://docs.traefik.io/configuration/acme/[ACME/Let's Encrypt provider] with the flags `--acme.*`:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
include::../../demo/traefik-v1/software-forge/docker-compose-ssl.yml[tag=traefik-entrypoints-acme]
----

== Problem 4/4

* **Problem**: Traefik detects itself as a docker container with a port, and tries to request a 2nd certificate for `edge.{lab-domain}`
+
* **Solution:** Exclude Traefik's container with the label `traefik.enable=false`

== Traefik Setup

* Step 1: Adapt Compose file:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
include::../../demo/traefik-v1/software-forge/docker-compose-ssl.yml[tag=traefik-ssl]
----

* Step 2: Update the `edge` service
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
docker-compose up -d edge
----

== Reality Check

Wait a few seconds (time to get the certificate from Let's Encrypt) and reload the main page:
