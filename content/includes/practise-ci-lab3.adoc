== Goal

We want to host the CI in Kubernetes and access it through Traefik

== Challenge 1/3

**Problem:** How to host the CI in Kubernetes?

== Deployment Object

**Solution:** Declare it as a `Deployment` object in `~/03-k8s-apps/ci.yml`.

--
* Explain differences between pod/container
* Explain differnces between deployment/statefulset/deamonset
* Explain the labels semantic/interest

== Challenge 2/2

**Problem:** How to access to the CI?
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
https://{lab-domain}/jenkins
  -> Traefik
    -> https://<Jenkins Private IP>/jenkins
----

== Service

**Solution:** Adding a service in `~/03-k8s-apps/ci.yml`.

== Ingress Rule

**Solution:** Adding an Ingress Rule in `~/03-k8s-apps/ci.yml`.

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::../../demo/lab-docker-k8s/03-k8s-apps/jenkins/deployment-svc-ingress.yml[tag=ingress]
----

== Apply the configuration

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
# Add the new objects
kubectl apply -f ~/03-k8s-apps/ci.yml
# Delete the headless service and its ingress rule (blue-green)
kubectl delete -f ~/02-k8s-traefik/ci.yml
