Why, Mr Anderson?

[.notes]
--
- Why reinventing reverse proxies ?
- This is a problem that has already been solved ?

- People usage of the internet is changing continuously
- Now everything is ultra connected emitting thousands of thousands of requests per minutes
- This raises new challenges in software design

== Evolution of Software Design

Mainframe ➡️  3-tiers ➡️ Microservices

[.notes]
--
- The way we write software is changing continuously
- Huge mainframe that does everything
- 3 tiers => presentation - business - database => splitting by logical role
- Microservices

- Congratulations you went from managing 2 applications to 2000.

Also, sometimes it doesn't work so well ?

- Network is unreliable
- Service gets too chatty
- It becomes a mess to debug
- That's what microservices are in real life. It's complicated and raises a looot of new questions.

- We're engineers, we built great tools to help us solve those problems.
- But let's look a it from the proxy point of view

== Configuring proxies with microservices IS hard

(Imagine the configuration file)

[.notes]
--
- But the struggle is real: configuring proxies for microservices is hard.

- Because the workload moves and changes all the time => The proxy needs to be reconfigured at each change.
- Because the routing can be complex

- Imagine doing this with with a configuration file ?
