== Goal

We want access to the CI hosted in Docker through Traefik in Kubernetes

== Challenge 1/2

**Problem:** How to tell to Traefik to route requests to the CI which is not deployed in Kubernetes?

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
https://{lab-domain}/jenkins
  -> Traefik Kubernetes
    -> Traefik Docker
      -> https://<Jenkins Private IP>/jenkins
----

== Headless Service

**Solution:** Use (once again) a service linked to an external address in `lab2-ci.yml`.

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::../../demo/lab-docker-k8s/02-k8s-traefik/jenkins/svc-ingress.yml[tag=svc]
----

== Challenge 2/2

**Problem:** How to detect the HTTPS requests to catch?

== Ingress Rule

**Solution:** Define a rule to catch all the incoming resquests for the `Path:/jenkins` in `lab2-ci.yml`.

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::../../demo/lab-docker-k8s/02-k8s-traefik/jenkins/svc-ingress.yml[tag=ingress]

== Apply the configuration

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -f ./lab2-ci.yml

It's good: we still can setup Jenkins!
