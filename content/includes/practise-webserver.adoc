= Simple Web Server

== Goal

* We want to host a static webserver under

== Problem

* How to tell Traefik to route requests to the web server?

```
http://traefik-demo.containous.cloud/
  -> Traefik
    -> http://<Webserver Private IP>:80/
```

== The Web Server Setup

* Step 1: web server in Compose. Check the `labels`:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
include::../../demo/docker-compose.yml[tag=web]
----

* Step 2: Start the Web Server:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d web
----

== Reality Check
