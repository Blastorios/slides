== The Hobbit House

We want a server in AWS:

* to host our own SCM Server,
* and our own Continous Integration,
* and a static web site,
* and a "web" command line.

== Infrastructure Setup

* An AWS VM with a public IP `35.178.178.237` and SSH access
* A domain name `{lab-domain}` pointing to `35.178.178.237`
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ dig +short {lab-domain}
35.178.178.237
----

* Docker and docker-compose for services
