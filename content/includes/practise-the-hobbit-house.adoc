We want to host:

* Our web site
* Our own SCM Server,
* Our own Continous Integration,
* and a "web" command line.

== Preparation

* Step 1: Access the spreadsheet at https://bit.ly/2Pdfe41[]
* Step 2: Select a line and put your name to allocate the VM
* Step 3: no Step 3!

== Infrastructure Setup

* An online shell to reach the lab infrastructure via SSH

* A public domain name `{lab-domain}` for your stack

* A VM in the cloud, to run your "legacy" Dockerized applications
** Connect to it from the WebCLI with `ssh {docker_vm_ip}`

* Docker and docker-compose installed on the "Docker" VM

== DNS Setup

* Connect to the "Blue-Green Jenkins":
** Link: link:https://bg.bastion.ddu-workshops-1.com/blue["Blue-Green Jenkins",window=_blank]
** Login with username `devoxx` and password `gandalf`

* Run the Job "change-dns"
** Link: https://bg.bastion.ddu-workshops-1.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/change-dns/activity[Job "change-dns",window=_blank]
** Specify the `EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME` of your lab (`labXX.ddu-workshops-Y.com`)
** Specify the `BACKEND_IP` of your Docker VM (`10.0.x.y`)

The external loadbalancer cannot reach our VM.
