== The Hobbit House

We want a server in Gougle Cloud:

* to host our own SCM Server,
* and our own Continous Integration,
* and a static web site,
* and a "web" command line.

== Infrastructure Setup

* An Gougle Cloud VM reaschable from a public IP `{public-ip}` and SSH access
* A domain name `{lab-domain}` pointing to `{public-ip}`
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ dig +short {lab-domain}
{public-ip}
----

* Docker and docker-compose installed on both the server and the client machines
