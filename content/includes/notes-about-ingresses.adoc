= Notes About The Ingresses

== Ingress Are Standard Kubernetes Applications

* Deployed as Pods (`Deployment` or as `DaemonSet`)
* Exposed with a Service:
** You still need access from the outside
** But only one service to deal with (ideally)

== Why Should I Care?

* Simplified Setup:
** Single entrypoint, less configuration, better measures
** Less resources used
** Separation of concerns: differents algorithms for load balancing, etc.

== Why Challenges Does It Make?

* Designed for (simple) HTTP/HTTPS cases
** TCP/UDP can be used, but are not first-class citizens
** "Virtual Host First" centric

* Feels like you must carefully select your (only) Ingress Controller

== So What?

* Kubernetes gives you freedom:
** You can use multiple Ingress Controllers!

* Kubernetes gives you choices:
** So much deployment patterns that you can do almost anything
