== The Castle

We want to terminate the migration of our services to the Kubernetes cluster.

== Infrastructure Setup

* Same VM as the Lab 2 (`ssh {kube_vm_ip}` from the webshell)

* `kubectl` and `helm` installed on the client machines

* Create a directory named `~/03-k8s-apps` as working directory
