= External Load Balancers

== Did you Just Say "External"?

* Outside the "Borders" of Kubernetes:
** Depends on your "platform" (as in infrastructure/cloud)

* Still Managed by Kubernetes (Automation)
** Requires "plugins" (operators/modules) per Load Balancer provider
** No API or no Kubernetes support: requires switching to `NodePort`

== Tell Me Your Kubernetes Distribution

...and I'll tell you which LB to use...

== Cloud Managed Kubernetes

* Cloud providers provides their own external LBs
** Fully Automated Management with APIs
** Great UX due to the integration: works out of the box
** Benefits from cloud provider HA and performances

* But:
** You have to pay for this :)
** Configuration is cloud-specific (using annotations)
** Relies on LB implementation limits

== Bare-Metal Kubernetes

Aka. "Run it on your boxes"

* Best approach: link:https://metallb.universe.tf/[Metal LB],
a Load Balancer implementation for Kubernetes, hosted **inside** Kubernetes
** Uses all Kubernetes primitives (HA, deployment, etc.)
** Allows Layer 2 routing as well as BGP
** But... still not considered production ready

* Otherwise: external static (or legacy) LB
** Requires switching to `NodePort` Service

== Cloud "Semi-Managed" Kubernetes

* Depends on the compute provider: cloud or bare-metal
* You need a tool for mananaging clusters: kubeadm, kops, etc.
** Most of these tools already manage LB if the provider does.
