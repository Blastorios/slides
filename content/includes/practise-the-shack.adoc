== The Shack

We want a server in Amazon EC2 cloud:

* to host our own SCM Server,
* and our own Continous Integration,
* and a static web site,
* and a "web" command line.

== Infrastructure Setup

* An AWS EC2 VM with a public IP `${VM_IP}` and SSH access
* A domain name `${PUBLIC_DOMAIN}` pointing to `${VM_IP}`
* Docker and docker-compose for services

== Infrastructure Setup Check

[source,bash]
----
# SSH Access OK with the domain name
ssh -i "${SUPER_SECRET_KEY}" ubuntu@"demo.containous.cloud"

# Docker and docker-compose installed
ubuntu@${VM_IP}:~$ docker version
Client:
 Version:           18.09.1
...
ubuntu@${VM_IP}:~$ docker-compose version
docker-compose version 1.23.2, build 1110ad01
